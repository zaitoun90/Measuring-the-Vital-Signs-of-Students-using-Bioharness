# Measuring-the-Vital-Signs-of-Students-using-Bioharness
The BioHarness is an example of a WHMS developed by the
Zephyr company, for monitoring the physiological conditions of individuals. The individual can use the BioHarness system during sporting and
other daily activities. To use the system, the person wears a smart fabric chest strap, embedded in the strap is the BioHarness Module. The
BioHarness Module contains several sensors for monitoring vital signs,
some examples include: heart rate, breathing rate and skin temperature
sensor heart ratesensors that facilitates the person to track This enables
the person to monitor his heart rate, breathing rate, skin temperature
among other vital signs.
The sensors within the BioHarness Module records raw sensor data, processes this raw sensor data and then analyzes the processed sensor data
within the BioHarness device. As such the device can operate in three
modes (i.e. transmit, record, transmit and record); which are software
configurable. In this project we implemented a BioHarness Vital Signs
Information System (BVSIS) to record the vital signs of sporting students and generate interesting patterns from the recorded data.
